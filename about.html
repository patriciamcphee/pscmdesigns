                            <p>I am an experienced, self-taught, and self-driven technical content writer.  My journey into tech started with a degree in Computer System Administration and a minor in programming. As I performed my duties as a System Administrator, I realized there was a need for documentation, for example, step-by-step procedures for troubleshooting and walk-throughs. Soon, I began my journey as a technical writer. </p>

                            <p>Before computers and before becoming a technical writer, I was a graphic designer in print media for eight years, and I enjoyed the creative process.  So, when it came to simplifying complex content, it meant getting creative with the presentation of the information, and this was designing infographics to supplement and complement the content.    </p>

                            <p>Recently, I've added voiceover as a new skill because of my transferrable knowledge and experience in the tech industry.  I have used my way with "words" throughout my 23-year technical writing career to inform, teach, and help my audience with computer technology. My background in computer networking, telecommunications, cloud storage, and software has me uniquely poised to understand a company's products and services.   </p>
